  - lineOfDialogue: We need to head to the breaker room and restore power to the
      facility. The bunker was running on emergency power, so the rest of the facility
      will need to be reconnected to the reactor for us to get out.

  - lineOfDialogue: What if the quake breached the reactor? Wouldn't that mean the
      radiation leaked?

      us from radiation.
